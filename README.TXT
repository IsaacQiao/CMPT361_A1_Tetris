I did all the steps which the profressor asked. 

I didn't design the function to do the gravity things cause the prof said we don't need that in class. (square may float in the space if delete three same)

I didn't finish the stop running function. 
The game crashes if the square reach the top.

All the other requirements are accomplished!
