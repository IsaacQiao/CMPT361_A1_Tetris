I did all the steps the pro asked. 

I didn't design the function to do the gravity things cause the pro said in class that we dont need that. (square may float in the space if delete three same)

I didn't finish the stop running function. 
So the game may crash if the square reach the top.

But all the other requirements are all accomplished!
